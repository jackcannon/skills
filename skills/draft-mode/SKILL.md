# draft-mode

Stay in this mode for the rest of the conversation until the user says to stop (e.g. "stop draft mode", "exit draft mode", "normal mode").

## Goal

Enable a fast feedback loop. The human decides when to verify. Do not slow them down by running builds, tests, or other checks after every edit.

## Banned by default

After making code changes, **do not** run any of the following unless the user explicitly asks for that action **in the same message**:

- Git: `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `fetch`, `merge`, `rebase`, `checkout`, `branch`, `stash`, `add`, `status` (for staging/commit flow), or any other git write/operation
- Builds / compile / bundle
- Tests
- Linters / formatters / typechecks
- Dev servers / watchers
- Browser-based verification (navigate, screenshot, snapshot, click-through)

Also do not offer or propose running these as a next step after edits.

## Explicit ask = one-time only

If the user asks for a banned action in a specific message:

1. Do that action **once** for that message.
2. Treat it as **not** standing permission.
3. After the next code change, return to the banned-by-default rules above.

Standing permission requires an explicit ongoing grant (e.g. "always run tests after changes" or "exit draft mode").

## Still allowed

- Edit files
- Read files, search, explore the codebase
- Ask clarifying questions
- Summarize what changed

## After edits

Stop when the change is done. Brief summary of what changed is fine. No verification ritual.
